## BAI
Basic Archlinux Installer - It does exactly what it's name says, nothing more, nothing less.\
You only set the drive you want to install to, your preferred language, the root password and you're done.

## Usage
You will need to boot into an archlinux installation medium, which you can get [here](https://archlinux.org/download/)\
After you get to the command line type:

`curl -sL miloszkusz.pl/BAI.sh | sh`

Then you set the few settings mentioned above and that's it.
